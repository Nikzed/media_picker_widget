### Android

To use this widget on Android, you need to add the following permissions to your _AndroidManifest.xml_ file, located in `<project root>/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

If your app targets `Android SDK 33`, as mentioned in the [Android 13 Behavior changes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13), you have to add the following permissions as well:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO"/>
```

### iOS

This plugin requires iOS 9.0 or higher.

Starting with version **0.8.1** the iOS implementation uses PHPicker to pick (multiple) images on iOS 14 or higher.
As a result of implementing PHPicker it becomes impossible to pick HEIC images on the iOS simulator in iOS 14+. This is a known issue. Please test this on a real device, or test with non-HEIC images until Apple solves this issue.
